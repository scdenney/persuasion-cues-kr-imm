## Project Overview
This paper investigates whether pro-immigration framing can shift public opinion in South Korea, a country facing demographic decline yet marked by skepticism toward immigration. We field a nationally representative survey experiment (n=2,010, January 2024) combining framing and conjoint designs to test whether messages emphasizing immigration’s role in sustaining economic growth or addressing low fertility affect policy preferences and reduce discrimination.

**Keywords**: immigration, persuasion, public opinion, survey experiments, South Korea  

## Methodology
- **Design**:  
  - Framing experiment testing growth and fertility cues on policy preferences.  
  - Choice-based conjoint (CBC) experiment on immigrant profiles (origin, ethnicity, occupation, language, etc.).  
- **Sample**: 2,010 South Koreans, recruited via Qualtrics online panel, representative with post-stratification weights.  
- **Analysis**: Logistic regression (policy outcomes) and OLS conjoint estimators (AMCEs and marginal means).  
- **Supplementary Information**: Includes survey details, survey instruments, subgroup analyses, and full treatment × attribute contrasts.  

## Key Findings
- **Policy attitudes are stable**: Neither growth nor fertility cues increase support for immigration liberalization.  
- **Status quo bias for growth frame**: the growth frame intervention significantly increases support for maintaining current levels (p < 0.05).  
- **Fertility frame limited**: Slightly reduces penalties against some non-ethnic Koreans (notably Filipinos).  
- **Entrenched hierarchies**: Origins-based discrimination, especially against Chinese immigrants, persists across treatments.

## Contributions
The paper makes four main contributions:  
1. Provides one of the first tests of persuasion effects on immigration attitudes in a non-Western democracy with a limited immigration history.  
2. Shows that growth frames reinforce status quo preferences, drawing support away from liberalization rather than encouraging it.  
3. Finds that fertility frames produce only modest reductions in discrimination, limited to some non-ethnic Korean immigrant profiles.  
4. Demonstrates the persistence of entrenched hierarchies of evaluation—especially origins-based penalties against Chinese immigrants—despite framing interventions.
